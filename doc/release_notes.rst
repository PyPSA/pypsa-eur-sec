PyPSA-Eur-Sec 0.2.0 (TBD)
==================================

* Link to DEA cost database in another GitHub repository.

* Myopic investment planning from Aarhus University.



PyPSA-Eur-Sec 0.1.0 (8th July 2020)
===================================

This is the first release of PyPSA-Eur-Sec, a model of the European energy system at the transmission network level that covers the full ENTSO-E area.

It is known to work with PyPSA-Eur v0.1.0 (commit bb3477cd69) and PyPSA v0.17.0.

We are making this release since in version 0.2.0 we will introduce changes to allow myopic investment planning that will require minor changes for users of the overnight investment planning.

PyPSA-Eur-Sec builds on the electricity generation and transmission
model `PyPSA-Eur <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur>`_ to add demand
and supply for the following sectors: transport, space and water
heating, biomass, industry and industrial feedstocks. This completes
the energy system and includes all greenhouse gas emitters except
waste management, agriculture, forestry and land use.

PyPSA-Eur-Sec was initially based on the model PyPSA-Eur-Sec-30 described
in the paper `Synergies of sector coupling and transmission
reinforcement in a cost-optimised, highly renewable European energy
system <https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05290>`_ (2018) but it differs by
being based on the higher resolution electricity transmission model
`PyPSA-Eur <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur>`_ rather than a
one-node-per-country model, and by including biomass, industry,
industrial feedstocks, aviation, shipping, better carbon management,
carbon capture and usage/sequestration, and gas networks.


PyPSA-Eur-Sec includes PyPSA-Eur as a
`snakemake <https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`_
`subworkflow <https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/modularization.html#snakefiles-sub-workflows>`_. PyPSA-Eur-Sec
uses PyPSA-Eur to build the clustered transmission model along with
wind, solar PV and hydroelectricity potentials and time series. Then
PyPSA-Eur-Sec adds other conventional generators, storage units and
the additional sectors.
