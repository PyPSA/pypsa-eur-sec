# PyPSA-Eur-Sec: A Sector-Coupled Open Optimisation Model of the European Energy System

PyPSA-Eur-Sec builds on the electricity generation and transmission
model [PyPSA-Eur](https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur) to add demand
and supply for the following sectors: transport, space and water
heating, biomass, industry and industrial feedstocks. This completes
the energy system and includes all greenhouse gas emitters except
waste management, agriculture, forestry and land use.

PyPSA-Eur-Sec includes PyPSA-Eur as a
[snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
[subworkflow](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/modularization.html#snakefiles-sub-workflows). PyPSA-Eur-Sec
uses PyPSA-Eur to build the clustered transmission model along with
wind, solar PV and hydroelectricity potentials and time series. Then
PyPSA-Eur-Sec adds other conventional generators, storage units and
the additional sectors.

Currently the scripts to solve and process the resulting PyPSA models
are also included in PyPSA-Eur-Sec, although they could in future be
better integrated with the corresponding scripts in PyPSA-Eur. A
stumbling block to sharing solve_network.py between PyPSA-Eur and
PyPSA-Eur-Sec is the different extra_functionality required to build
storage and CHP constraints.

# Installation

First install [PyPSA-Eur](https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur) and all
its dependencies. Clone the repository:
```shell
projects % git clone git@github.com:PyPSA/pypsa-eur.git
```
then download and unpack all the data files.

Create a parallel directory for PyPSA-Eur-Sec with:
```shell
projects % git clone git@github.com:nworbmot/pypsa-eur-sec.git
```

## Package requirements

The requirements are the same as
[PyPSA-Eur](https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur), but for
`solve_network.py` in addition you need `gurobipy` and the `nomopyomo`
branch of PyPSA, which are currently imported "by hand" at the start
of the `solve_network.py` script. The `nomopyomo` branch will be
merged into the future PyPSA release 0.16.0.


## Data requirements

The data requirements include the JRC-IDEES-2015 database, JRC biomass
potentials, EEA emission statistics, Eurostat Energy Balances, urban
district heating potentials, emobility statistics, timezone mappings
and heating profiles.

The data bundle is about 640 MB.

To download and extract it on the command line:
```shell
projects/pypsa-eur-sec/data % wget "https://nworbmot.org/pypsa-eur-sec-data-bundle-190719.tar.gz"
projects/pypsa-eur-sec/data % tar xvzf pypsa-eur-sec-data-bundle-190719.tar.gz
```
